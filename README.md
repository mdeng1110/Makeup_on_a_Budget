# Inspiration
I was inspired by makeup videos, where it mentions budgeting for makeup.


# What it does
Makeup on a Budget looks for makeup products found on the Sephora website that are under a certain amount of money (USD) and within a certain customer rating threshold. It adds the products to a beauty haul list and informs the user the total cost before taxes and fees. The user has the option to add the products to the Sephora cart.

# How we built it
I wrote Makeup on a Budget as a Django web application with bootstrap CSS styling.

# Challenges we ran into
The following are the challenges that I ran into:
- Needed to develop an optimizer for selecting beauty products
- Have to learn Django
- Only using a small sample data set of Sephora products, instead of retrieving the full list of products from the Sephora website

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the fact that I was able to create a working prototype for the project in less than two weeks.

# What we learned
I learned how to fully implement a web application using Django. I also learned about various optimization strategies for product cart optimizations.

# What's next for Make Up on a Budget
The following is next for Make Up on a Budget:
- Integrate with Sephora API
- Improve Optimization Algorithm
- Improve UI/UX
